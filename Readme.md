## About the module

### Pros

* High speed, 9 bit ADCs!
* Full [Altium source](/elmo/source/v2/elmov2_altium.zip), [Gerbers](/elmo/source/v2/elmov2_gerber.zip), [BOM](/elmo/source/v2/BOM.xls), [schematics](/elmo/source/v2/ADC_pHAT.pdf).
* [Driver](/elmo/standard_driver.c) for the board.

### Cons

* SMDs is tough to assemble
* Linux is not real time: there will be inaccuracies in the measurements!
* Need a custom kernel module

## Constraint and limits

* See above ;)

### Discussions

#### Where can I get elements to play with ?

You can refer to the [20180415r](/include/20180415r/) experiment. It is made of a unipolar pulser, double ADC board, and analog processing board. The experiment documentations is based on :

* [Raspberry Pi drivers](/include/20180415r/driver.c) which create the /dev/ device on the raspberry pi from which a `cat /dev/hsdk/ > Datafile.DAT` extracts signals. The driver includes control for the pulser.
* An example of [Raw data](/include/20180415r/lit-tbo.DAT) that is created out of the driver
* [the Jupyter notebook](/include/20180415r/20180415r-lit.tbo.ipynb) which processes capture files from the ADC into signals
* the resulting [Processed data](/include/20180415r/lit-tbo.npz)

Even without the board, you can use an example of such a file to play with.

#### Let's start with the end: it works!

Testing the module with the [signal emulator module](/silent/), which yields a signal at 1.9MHz, it well seen at 1.9MHz, with a sampling speed equal to two times this freq, ie 24Msps ! See the details below:

#### Test at 250kHz

Experiment is [detailed here](/include/community/Uwe/20180620a).

##### Connected to the ADC, then to a RPi through a ribbon

##### Results

#### Problem and solution

__Problem__ was that the Pi0 or PiW, with the current kernel module, can't run faster than around 10 to 12 Msps. Clock can be faster, but the _memcpy_ limits the transfer to memory. Soooo.. what can we do? As a reminder, I wanted at least a 10Msps 10bit ADC.

__Solution__ Why not interleaving two ADCs, with clocks in opposite phase? Hum that means 2 times 10 bits, and I had only 18 pins left once the Ultrasound SDK board connected. That means.. quite obviously, 2 times 9 bits.

So now I can run at twice the speed of the transfer, so a bit over 20Msps, over this time 9 bits. Or by oversampling, that could be 10Msps at 10 bits. __With more flexibility__ !

Win.

At least for the moment, now I need to order the PCBs and some components.

-> [BOM](/elmo/source/v2/BOM.xls) is around 30$ components, 5$ OSHPark PCB.. that's quite neat.

#### Raw signal acquisition and enveloppe with this ADC pHAT

With the raw signal

#### First acquisitions:

See the [jupyter notebook](/elmo/data/20170609-NewADC-v3.ipynb):

![](/elmo/images/3rdAcq-low.png)

Issues: bugs in connected ADC pins + no offset really


#### What does it look like ?

##### Without headers

and the corresponding [schematics (PDF)](/elmo/source/v2/ADC_pHAT.pdf).

##### On the motherboard

__Beware__ the motherboard is designed to have the phat assembled as shown below

or as below:

### TODO

* Lots

### DONE

* Write the [Quickstart](/elmo/QuickStart.md)
* Getting a board an soldering some ADCs
* Understand GPIO [mem mapping](/elmo/data/20170609-NewADC.ipynb)
* Get raw data with [offset vref/2](/elmo/data/arduinoffset/20170612-ArduinoFFTed.ipynb)
* Tests with a single ADC at 11Msps
* Produce a batch of [rev2 elmo](/elmo/source/v2/elmov2_altium.zip)
