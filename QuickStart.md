## Quickstart of the ADC module

### Hardware steps

#### For the [motherboard PCB based solution](/doj/)...

Just plug it into the board!

Beware of the headers! The idea is to have connections between the board and the pHAT. You can use any type of headers =)

#### For a standalone version

* The ADC onboard selector (3x2) enables one to check input, either through the RPi pin, or the onboard entry.
* the 3x1 jumper allows one to offset a 0-centered signal to have an offset of vRef/2 (ie the zero will go to the middle of the range)

### The [ADC](/elmo/) module

You can use the [standalone SD card image](http://kghosh.me/img/sdc.img.gz). Alternatively, you can setup the development environment as described below.

The standard module code is [here](/elmo/standard_driver.c) and can be compiled using [these steps](/elmo/data/PrepKernel.sh).

The full procedures are described at on the [raspberry doc page](/retired/tomtom/)

Log now on this raspberry, and run the _run.sh_ command to load the driver of the ADC. You'll see that the module appears as a  __/dev/hsdk__ device.

Capture occurs with a 

    cat /dev/hsdk > myfilename.dat

Then copy the newly created file on your PC or where you need it. It dumps the raw GPIOs signals as [described here](/elmo/data/20170613-TestWithRawSignal.ipynb). Then a bit of python magic is used to reorder the bits in a way to reconstruct the signal from the two ADCs. __You can see an example of acquisition here on this [jupyter notebook](/elmo/data/20170714-TwoADCs-Probe.ipynb).__ Another alternative to see how this work is to check [an acquisition run with a 3.3Vpp signal](/include/community/Uwe/20180620a/20180620a-Uwe.ipynb)

Beware! If you want to get a signal between [-1.5V and 1.5V], consider using a in series with input to remove all DC bias, and make sure the jumper are set as in the images above.
